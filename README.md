# Yet Another Agent Container

Agent sandbox manager — run many parallel agent sessions, each as an isolated Kubernetes Job on a local single-node cluster. Supports Claude Code, Codex CLI, and OpenCode.

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS, arm64)

```sh
brew trust bsklaroff/yaac
brew trust libkrun/krun
brew install bsklaroff/yaac/yaac
yaac cluster setup   # podman machine + registry + kind cluster + Cilium
```

The formula pulls in the whole toolchain: `node`, `kubectl`, `cilium-cli`,
`podman` (>= 6.0), a pinned `kind` build (`yaac-kind` — see the
[version-skew note](docs/cluster-setup.md#version-skew-podman-6x-needs-a-patched-kind)),
and `krunkit` (from the `libkrun/krun` tap).

### From source (development)

A dev install **replaces** the brew one — both want to own the same
`bin/yaac` symlink, so never keep both installed (`brew uninstall yaac`
first if you have the package; switch back later with
`npm uninstall -g @bsklaroff/yaac && brew install bsklaroff/yaac/yaac`).

#### macOS (arm64)

Install the toolchain the formula would otherwise pull in:

```sh
brew trust bsklaroff/yaac
brew trust libkrun/krun
brew install node pnpm kubernetes-cli cilium-cli podman bsklaroff/yaac/yaac-kind
brew install libkrun/krun/krunkit
```

#### Linux

```sh
sudo apt install podman nodejs npm acl   # Debian/Ubuntu 26.04+
sudo npm install -g pnpm
curl -fsSLo kind "https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.32.0/kind-linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture)"
sudo install -m 755 kind /usr/local/bin/kind && rm kind
curl -fsSLo kubectl "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -fsSL https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/$(dpkg --print-architecture)/kubectl"
sudo install -m 755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl && rm kubectl

# yaac uses rootful podman on Linux (the cilium agent needs it); enable the
# socket and grant your user access:
sudo systemctl enable --now podman.socket
sudo setfacl -m u:$USER:x /run/podman
sudo setfacl -m u:$USER:rw /run/podman/podman.sock
```

The apt-shipped podman 5.x works fine on Linux and pairs with stock kind
v0.32.0; only podman 6.x needs the pinned kind build (see the
[version-skew note](docs/cluster-setup.md#version-skew-podman-6x-needs-a-patched-kind)).
yaac drives the **rootful** podman engine on Linux — kind's node needs the
cgroup2 root and BPF filesystem that rootless podman doesn't delegate, or the
cilium agent DaemonSet hangs (see
[Linux: rootful podman](docs/cluster-setup.md#linux-rootful-podman)).

#### Both platforms

Then build, link, and wire the cluster:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bsklaroff/yaac.git
cd yaac
pnpm install
pnpm build
npm install -g .      # symlinks the checkout — every pnpm build is live
yaac cluster setup
```

## Web app

yaac ships a local web app — a GUI over the same server the CLI drives.
Launch it with:

```sh
yaac open
```

This starts the server if needed and opens your browser straight into the
authenticated app: a live session sidebar, the project list, and an embedded
terminal (xterm.js) attached to each session's tmux. `yaac open --no-browser`
prints the URL instead of launching a browser.

It's local-first — the server binds `127.0.0.1` only, and the browser
authenticates with an `HttpOnly` cookie obtained from a one-time bootstrap
code that `yaac open` handles for you (no manual pasting). The CLI and web
app drive the same on-disk state, so you can mix them freely.

See [docs/remote-hosting.md](docs/remote-hosting.md) for running the server
on an always-on server and using this machine as a thin client.

Detach from a tmux session with `Ctrl-B D`. Kill the tmux session (and the
container) with `Ctrl-B K` (custom binding, not standard tmux). Open a new
shell in the tmux session with `Ctrl-B C`, and switch between shells with `Ctrl-B N` (next) and
`Ctrl-B P` (previous).

## Authentication

yaac centralizes credentials on the host and injects them into session traffic through the shared proxy (a `yaac-proxy` Deployment in the cluster). Real tokens are never written into the container filesystem. Credentials live under `~/.yaac/.credentials/` (directory permissions `0700`, files `0600`), split by service:

- `~/.yaac/.credentials/github.json` — GitHub tokens
- `~/.yaac/.credentials/claude.json` — Claude Code credentials (OAuth bundle or API key)
- `~/.yaac/.credentials/codex.json` — Codex credentials
- `~/.yaac/.credentials/opencode.json` — OpenCode credentials (OpenRouter API key)

The proxy pod mounts this directory RW (hostPath) and reads credentials at request time, so updates via `yaac auth update` propagate to every running session immediately without needing to restart pods. The proxy is reachable only inside the cluster (ClusterIP Service); the server talks to it over a loopback `kubectl port-forward`.

### GitHub tokens

yaac requires one or more GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs) for git operations and GitHub API access inside session containers. Multiple tokens can be scoped to different owners so you can use separate tokens for different orgs or personal repos.

Tokens are stored as an ordered list. When yaac needs a token for a given repo, it walks the list and uses the first matching entry:

```json
{
  "tokens": [
    { "kind": "https", "pattern": "github.com/acme-corp/*", "token": "ghp_org_scoped_token" },
    { "kind": "https", "pattern": "github.com/my-user/private-repo", "token": "ghp_repo_scoped_token" },
    { "kind": "https", "pattern": "gitlab.com/group/sub/*", "token": "glpat_subgroup_token" },
    { "kind": "https", "pattern": "github.com/*", "token": "ghp_fallback_token" }
  ]
}
```

Each pattern is host-prefixed and takes one of these forms:
- `<host>/*` — matches every repo on `<host>`
- `<host>/<path>` — matches a specific repo at `<path>` (any depth: `acme/foo`, `group/sub/repo`, or a single segment like `myrepo` for Gerrit-style hosts)
- `<host>/<prefix>/*` — matches every repo whose path starts with `<prefix>` (the prefix itself can span multiple segments, e.g. `gitlab.com/group/sub/*`)

First match wins, so put more specific patterns before broader ones. On first run, yaac prompts for a token if none are configured.

Tokens are used for:
- **Host-side git operations** — clone and fetch use HTTPS with the matching token embedded in the request.
- **Session-side GitHub requests** — the MITM proxy injects the token as an `Authorization` header into all HTTPS requests to `github.com` and `api.github.com`. The token is never written into the container filesystem. Each session uses the single token that matches its project's remote URL.

Token injection only happens over HTTPS. Plain HTTP requests through the proxy never receive credentials.

### Agent tool credentials

yaac also manages the API credentials for the agent tool itself, so Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode don't need to authenticate inside each container. On first run (or via `yaac auth update`), yaac runs the tool's native login flow on the host and stores the resulting credentials. OpenCode is API-key only (OpenRouter): the key stays on the host and the proxy swaps the in-container placeholder on requests to openrouter.ai.

For Claude Code OAuth, each project's `.claude/.credentials.json` inside the container holds placeholder tokens (`yaac-ph-access` / `yaac-ph-refresh`) together with the real `expiresAt` and scopes. The proxy transparently rewrites outbound API calls, swaps the placeholder refresh token on refresh requests, and writes refreshed bundles back to the host file — so real tokens never enter the container filesystem. For API-key mode (both tools) the proxy injects the key as an outbound header.

## Session layout

Each session runs as a single-pod Kubernetes Job with the following hostPath mounts:

| Host | Container | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `~/.yaac/projects/<project>/worktrees/<session-id>` | `/workspace` | Project code (working directory) |
| `~/.yaac/projects/<project>/repo/.git` | `/repo/.git` | Repository metadata |
| `~/.yaac/projects/<project>/claude/` | `/home/yaac/.claude` | Claude Code configuration |
| `~/.yaac/projects/<project>/claude.json` | `/home/yaac/.claude.json` | Claude Code project settings |
| `~/.yaac/projects/<project>/codex/` | `/home/yaac/.codex` | Codex configuration and transcripts |
| `~/.yaac/projects/<project>/opencode-config/` | `/home/yaac/.config/opencode` | OpenCode configuration (shared per project) |
| `~/.yaac/projects/<project>/opencode-data/<session-id>` | `/home/yaac/.local/share/opencode` | OpenCode session data (per session) |
| `~/.yaac/projects/<project>/.cached-packages` | `/home/yaac/.cached-packages` | Per-project package-manager caches |

The session container runs as user `yaac` with home directory `/home/yaac`. All project data is stored under `~/.yaac/projects/<repo-name>/` on the host — which is why the cluster node must have your home directory extraMounted (see [Cluster setup](docs/cluster-setup.md#what-it-wires-up)). The repo plus the Claude and Codex state directories are shared across all sessions within a project (but isolated between projects), so those sessions can inspect each other's history; OpenCode session data is per-session to avoid concurrent-write issues in its database. Each session gets its own git worktree.

The `.cached-packages` directory is shared by every session within the project, so package-manager caches survive session teardown and are reused across sessions. pnpm's default `store-dir` is pre-configured to `/home/yaac/.cached-packages/pnpm-store`, so `pnpm install` populates the per-project store automatically with no extra configuration.

## Project configuration

Per-machine, per-project configuration lives under each project's data dir:

```
~/.yaac/projects/<repo-name>/config/yaac-config.json
~/.yaac/projects/<repo-name>/config/Dockerfile.yaac
~/.yaac/Dockerfile.user
```

The easiest way to populate these is in `$EDITOR`:

```
yaac config edit <project>             # yaac-config.json
yaac config edit-dockerfile <project>  # Dockerfile.yaac
yaac config edit-user-dockerfile       # ~/.yaac/Dockerfile.user (global)
```

Example `yaac-config.json` with all options:

```json
{
  "envPassthrough": ["TERM", "LANG"],
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "development",
    "MY_FLAG": "1"
  },
  "envSecretProxy": {
    "MY_API_KEY": {
      "hosts": ["api.example.com"],
      "header": "x-api-key"
    },
    "OAUTH_CLIENT_ID": {
      "hosts": ["auth.example.com"],
      "path": "/oauth/*",
      "bodyParam": "client_id"
    },
    "OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET": {
      "hosts": ["auth.example.com"],
      "path": "/oauth/*",
      "bodyParam": "client_secret"
    }
  },
  "bindMounts": [
    { "hostPath": "$HOME/datasets", "containerPath": "/mnt/datasets", "mode": "ro" },
    { "hostPath": "$HOME/models", "containerPath": "/mnt/models", "mode": "rw" }
  ],
  "cacheVolumes": {
    "pip-cache": "/home/yaac/.cache/pip"
  },
  "initCommands": ["pnpm install"],
  "addAllowedUrls": ["internal.corp.example.com", "*.mycdn.example.com"],
  "hideInitPane": false
}
```

- **envPassthrough** — environment variables passed directly from your host to the container.
- **env** — environment variables hardcoded with literal values, baked into the container at session creation. Applied after `envPassthrough`, so a name listed in both takes the literal value here. Values are not expanded — `"$HOME"` is passed through as the literal string `$HOME`.
- **envSecretProxy** — environment variables injected via a MITM proxy into HTTPS requests. The actual secret value never enters the container. Each entry specifies how the secret is injected:
  - **`hosts`** — hostnames to intercept (required).
  - **`header`** — inject as this HTTP header (default: `"authorization"`). When using the default header, the value is automatically prefixed with `"Bearer "`. Use `prefix` to override.
  - **`bodyParam`** — instead of a header, replace this form/JSON body parameter. Useful for OAuth client credentials that are sent in POST bodies.
  - **`path`** — only inject on matching URL paths (default `"/*"`). Supports `*` wildcards.

  Each entry must have either `header` or `bodyParam` (not both).

  Note: GitHub authentication (`github.com` and `api.github.com`) is handled automatically using your stored PAT — you do not need to add `GITHUB_TOKEN` to `envSecretProxy`.
- **bindMounts** — host directories mounted into the container. Each entry specifies:
  - **`hostPath`** — absolute path on the host (required). Environment variables like `$HOME` or `${HOME}` are expanded.
  - **`containerPath`** — absolute path inside the container (required).
  - **`mode`** — `"ro"` for read-only or `"rw"` for read-write (required).

  For ad-hoc mounts at session creation time, use the `--add-dir` / `--add-dir-rw` CLI flags instead. These mount the host directory under `/add-dir/<host-path>` inside the container and automatically pass it to Claude Code via `--add-dir`.
- **cacheVolumes** — per-project persistent cache directories mounted into the container. Keys are cache names (backed by `~/.yaac/projects/<project>/cache-volumes/<name>` on the host), values are absolute container paths. Caches persist across sessions. Note: a per-project `~/.yaac/projects/<project>/.cached-packages` directory is already bind-mounted at `/home/yaac/.cached-packages` on every container for pnpm (and other package-manager caches you want to share across sessions), so you don't need a `cacheVolumes` entry for pnpm's store.
- **initCommands** — commands run inside the container after it starts (e.g. `pnpm install` against the warm shared cache). These run on every session, not just the first. Accepts two shapes (cannot be mixed):
  - **String list** — all commands are chained with `&&` and run in a single tmux window named `init`, parallel to the agent:
    ```json
    "initCommands": ["pnpm install", "pnpm build"]
    ```
  - **Object list** — one tmux window per entry, so multiple long-running processes (e.g. a backend and a frontend dev server) run in parallel and can be inspected independently. Each entry has a `name` (the tmux window name; must not collide with the agent window — `claude` / `codex` / `opencode` / `init` / `yaac` are reserved), a `commands` array (chained with `&&` inside that window), and an optional `hidePane` that overrides the top-level `hideInitPane` for this window. Windows are spawned independently, so any shared setup (e.g. `pnpm install`) should be listed in each window that needs it:
    ```json
    "initCommands": [
      { "name": "backend",  "commands": ["pnpm install", "pnpm dev:backend"] },
      { "name": "frontend", "commands": ["pnpm install", "pnpm dev:frontend"] }
    ]
    ```
- **hideInitPane** — when `true`, the init commands tmux pane is automatically closed after the commands finish or error (default: `false`). When `false`, the pane is preserved with `remain-on-exit` so you can inspect the output.
- **addAllowedUrls** — additional host patterns to allow on top of the [default allowlist](packages/server/src/lib/container/default-allowed-hosts.ts). By default, the proxy blocks outbound requests to hosts not on the default list. Use this to add extra hosts without replacing the defaults. Supports exact hostnames (`api.example.com`) and wildcards (`*.example.com`).
- **setAllowedUrls** — completely replaces the default allowlist with the given list of host patterns. Cannot be used together with `addAllowedUrls`. Set to `["*"]` to allow all outbound URLs (disables filtering), or `[]` to block all external network access. If the resolved list does not include `api.anthropic.com` or `github.com`, a warning is printed since sessions require these to function.
- **nestedContainers** — run an in-pod rootless podman so `docker build` / `docker run` / `docker compose up --build` work inside the session exactly as a project README instructs (the `docker` CLI talks to podman's Docker-API socket). See [Nested containers and virtual clusters](#nested-containers-and-virtual-clusters).
- **virtualCluster** — give each session its own virtual kubernetes cluster (vcluster) plus a per-project push registry. Implies `nestedContainers` (setting `"nestedContainers": false` alongside it is a config error).

## Environment variables

Every yaac variable is read in one place — [`packages/shared/src/env.ts`](packages/shared/src/env.ts) — which owns its default and validation. The rest of the codebase imports the typed `env` / `testEnv` accessors instead of touching `process.env`.

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `YAAC_DATA_DIR` | `~/.yaac` | Data directory holding projects, sessions, and the server lock. |
| `YAAC_SERVER_PORT` | `8787` | Port the server binds on `127.0.0.1` (auto-increments if busy). `0` requests an OS-assigned ephemeral port. |
| `YAAC_USE_TOR` | `false` | Route the server's host-side git/ssh through a Tor SOCKS proxy. Off when unset/empty/`0`/`false`; any other value is on. |
| `YAAC_HOST_TOR_SOCKS_URL` | `socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050` | SOCKS endpoint used when `YAAC_USE_TOR` is on. |
| `YAAC_K8S_REGISTRY` | `localhost:5001` | `host:port` of the local OCI registry the cluster pulls session images from. |
| `YAAC_KIND_CLUSTER` | `yaac` | Name of the kind cluster `yaac cluster setup` creates/repairs. |
| `YAAC_PREWARM_POOL_SIZE` | `1` | Prewarmed sessions kept ready per active project (`0` disables prewarming). |
| `YAAC_NESTED` | _(unset)_ | Set to `1` automatically by the server inside a nested (vcluster) session — not something you set yourself. |
| `YAAC_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | _(unset)_ | Comma-separated extra hostnames the server's Host-header check admits (e.g. its tailnet name behind `tailscale serve`). Loopback is always allowed. |
| `YAAC_TRUST_PROXY` | _(unset)_ | `1` when the server runs behind a trusted TLS-terminating proxy: trusts `X-Forwarded-Proto` to mark the session cookie `Secure`. |
| `YAAC_FORWARD_BIND` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address for session port-forward listeners; a remote-hosting server sets its tailnet IP so forwarded dev servers are reachable from other devices. |
| `YAAC_BUNDLED` | _(unset)_ | Set to `true` by the build (tsup) in the shipped bundle so it loads assets from `dist/`. Build-time define, not a runtime knob. |
| `EDITOR` / `VISUAL` | `vi` | Editor opened by the `yaac config edit*` commands (git's convention: `$EDITOR`, then `$VISUAL`, then `vi`). |

`YAAC_UID` is a Docker **build arg** (not a runtime variable) — see [Custom images](#custom-images).

### Internal & testing

These are set by the build or the test harness; production reads several of them only via their defaults.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `YAAC_K8S_NAMESPACE` | `yaac` | Namespace holding every yaac k8s object. E2e runs isolate per-file namespaces here. |
| `YAAC_IMAGE_PREFIX` | _(unset)_ | Prefix applied to built/pushed image names (test isolation). |
| `YAAC_PROXY_IMAGE` | `yaac-proxy` | Proxy image tag override. |
| `YAAC_REQUIRE_PREBUILT_IMAGES` | _(unset)_ | `1` fails fast if a required image isn't already in the registry (CI/e2e). |
| `YAAC_STARTING_GRACE_MS` | `60000` | Grace window (ms) protecting freshly-created session pods from the stale-session reaper. |
| `YAAC_BUILD_ID` | _(unset)_ | Override the build id for tests running from source (no `dist/.build-id`). |
| `YAAC_SERVER_URL` / `YAAC_SERVER_SECRET` | _(unset)_ | Point the CLI at an in-process server without the lock file (tests). |
| `YAAC_E2E_NO_ATTACH` | _(unset)_ | `1` skips the post-provision terminal attach (no-TTY e2e). |
| `YAAC_E2E_SKIP_FETCH` | _(unset)_ | `1` skips the host-side git fetch during create (e2e fixtures pre-populate the repo). |
| `YAAC_E2E_CLAUDE_LOGIN` / `YAAC_E2E_CODEX_LOGIN` / `YAAC_E2E_OPENCODE_LOGIN` | _(unset)_ | Short-circuit the native tool login with a serialized OAuth bundle (claude/codex) or raw api key (opencode). |
| `YAAC_E2E_OPENCODE_PROVIDER` | _(unset)_ | Picks the opencode provider during e2e login (defaults to openrouter). |

The proxy and relay sidecar containers read their own internal variables (`API_PORT`, `PROXY_AUTH_SECRET`, `TRANSPARENT_HTTPS_PORT`, `TRANSPARENT_HTTP_PORT`, `TRANSPARENT_TUNNEL_PORT`, `DNS_STUB_PORT`, `USE_TOR`, and the `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_*` pair). The server and cluster inject these when building each pod spec — they are not user-configurable.

## Custom images

The default image (Ubuntu 24.04 + Node.js + pnpm + Claude Code + gh + tmux) can be customized:

- **`Dockerfile.yaac`** — customizes the base image. Behavior depends on the `FROM` line:
  - **Layered (recommended)** — layers on top of the default image. The default Dockerfile is built first, then Dockerfile.yaac is applied on top. Use this to add packages or config while keeping the standard Ubuntu + Node.js + Claude Code environment. Must use `ARG BASE_IMAGE` and `FROM ${BASE_IMAGE}` so the parent image is injected via `--build-arg`:
    ```dockerfile
    ARG BASE_IMAGE
    FROM ${BASE_IMAGE}
    # Rest of Dockerfile...
    ```
  - **Any other `FROM`** — replaces the default image entirely (e.g. use a different base distro or toolchain). Must install Claude Code yourself, since the default Dockerfile is skipped.

  Place at `~/.yaac/projects/<repo-name>/config/Dockerfile.yaac`, or open it in `$EDITOR` with `yaac config edit-dockerfile <project>`.
- **`~/.yaac/Dockerfile.user`** — applied on top of whichever base is used (e.g. nvim config, shell customization). Must use `ARG BASE_IMAGE` and `FROM ${BASE_IMAGE}` so the parent image is injected via `--build-arg`:
  ```dockerfile
  ARG BASE_IMAGE
  FROM ${BASE_IMAGE}
  # Rest of Dockerfile...
  ```

Layer order: default → Dockerfile.tools (agent CLIs; rebuilt by `yaac project rebuild`) → Dockerfile.nestable (only when `nestedContainers` is on) → Dockerfile.yaac (if layered) → Dockerfile.user. A standalone Dockerfile.yaac replaces the default + tools (+ nestable) layers entirely.

## Nested containers and virtual clusters

**`nestedContainers: true`** runs a rootless podman inside the session pod and points the `docker` CLI (and compose) at its Docker-API socket:

- `docker build` / `docker run` / `docker compose up --build` work as-is. Image pulls ride the session's transparent egress to the MITM proxy: the upstream registries (docker.io, ghcr.io, quay.io and their CDNs) are auto-added to the session allowlist, and anything else is denied fail-closed. Build `RUN` steps and nested containers automatically trust the proxy CA.
- Nested containers share the pod's network namespace: a container's listener is reachable on `localhost:<port>` directly (`docker run -p` is a no-op — the app binds the port itself), and container-private networks are unsupported — use `network_mode: host` in compose files.
- Built layers are promoted into a per-project shared store at session teardown, so an identical `docker build` in the next session is a pure cache hit.

**`virtualCluster: true`** additionally gives the session its own kubernetes cluster:

- `kubectl` inside the session is preconfigured (`KUBECONFIG`) against a per-session [vcluster](https://www.vcluster.com/); `kubectl get nodes`, `kubectl run`, deployments, services, and inner NetworkPolicies all work. Pods created in the vcluster actually run on the host cluster, confined to the session: they can reach their own vcluster's API and each other, and nothing else (no host apiserver, no internet — in v1 synced pods have no upstream egress at all).
- A synced-pod admission guard (ValidatingAdmissionPolicy, kubernetes >= 1.30) blocks hostNetwork/hostPID/hostIPC/hostPorts/privileged, restricts hostPath volumes to the session's `nested-yaac` data dir, and requires a user namespace (`hostUsers: false`) for added capabilities. vcluster creation fails closed (with no opt-out) when the VAP API is missing.
- Each project gets a plain-HTTP push registry (`registry:2`) reachable from its sessions as `yaac-reg-<project>.<namespace>.svc:5000` — build an image, `docker push` it there, and `kubectl run` the pushed ref in the vcluster (the node pulls it through a containerd `hosts.toml` mapping). Only the project's own sessions can reach its registry. Stale content-hash tags accumulate until project removal or cluster recreate (registry:2 has no safe online GC).
- Each vcluster costs roughly 0.5Gi of memory, so mind how many vcluster sessions run at once.

**yaac-in-yaac**: vcluster sessions are preset for running yaac itself inside the session — `YAAC_NESTED=1`, `YAAC_DATA_DIR` pointing at a host-visible per-session dir, and `YAAC_K8S_REGISTRY` pointing at the project registry. Inner yaac refuses `virtualCluster` — no vcluster-in-vcluster.
