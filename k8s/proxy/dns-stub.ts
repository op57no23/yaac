/**
 * Minimal DNS wire-format helpers for the proxy's UDP/53 stub — pure (no
 * deps, no I/O). Session pods point their resolver (dnsConfig.nameservers) at
 * the proxy; the proxy's UDP handler (proxy.ts) is split-horizon:
 *
 *   - EXTERNAL names get a fixed sinkhole IP. That answer is decorative —
 *     Cilium redirects egress by port (443/80) and the proxy routes by TLS SNI
 *     / HTTP Host, never by the dialed address — so a constant sinkhole is all
 *     a client needs, and resolving nothing real keeps the DNS-tunnelling
 *     channel closed.
 *   - INTERNAL names (`*.cluster.local`, see isInternalName) are forwarded to
 *     the real cluster DNS so the pod learns the live, allocator-assigned
 *     ClusterIP of in-cluster Services (the per-project registry, its vcluster
 *     API) — which is what lets yaac stop pinning those ClusterIPs.
 *
 * This module only parses/classifies/builds; the resolve-or-sinkhole decision
 * and the upstream lookup live in proxy.ts. Everything that is not IN/A (AAAA
 * included) gets an empty NOERROR — not NXDOMAIN — so dual-query resolvers fall
 * through to the A answer, and a failed internal lookup is answered the same
 * way (ip === null below). The TC bit is never set, so resolvers never retry
 * over tcp/53.
