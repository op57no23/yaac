/**
 * Centralized icon set. Everything imports icons from here under semantic
 * names, so the underlying library is referenced in exactly one place.
 * Backed by lucide-react (free, open-source). Icons take a `size` prop and
 * inherit `currentColor`, so text-* utilities color them.
 *
 * (A Central Icons variant — round-filled, with real brand glyphs — is kept
 * on the `claude/central-icons-ref` branch for reference; it depends on a
 * gated paid package, so it can't be the default. Agent tools are now shown
 * by name rather than a glyph, since lucide has no brand marks.)
