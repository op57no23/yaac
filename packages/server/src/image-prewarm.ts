/**
 * Background-loop step that keeps every project's image chain built and
 * pushed, so session create finds warm images instead of paying a podman
 * build (minutes after a Dockerfile.default edit) inside the create request.
 *
 * Each tick sweeps all projects and fires one detached prewarm task per
 * project not already in flight — the tick body itself never blocks on a
 * build. Concurrent chains coalesce per-tag in the build coordinator:
 * two projects needing the same base wait on one build, then their distinct
 * downstream layers build in parallel.
 *
 * Runs in nested yaac sessions too — in-pod podman builds are slower, but
 * that's exactly when proactive building pays off (editing dockerfiles from
 * inside a yaac-in-yaac dev session is the hot path), and the coordinator's
 * single-flight dedup means a session create just joins the sweep's build.
 * Skipped in e2e (images are prebuilt by the global setup; workers must
 * never race a build).
