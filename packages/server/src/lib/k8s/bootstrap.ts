 * it to a session — see k8s/proxy), not an HMAC token.
 *
 * The `cec.cilium.io/use-original-source-address: "false"` annotation is
 * load-bearing: without it Cilium binds the upstream socket to the client pod
 * IP, and forwarding to a fixed proxy (not the original dst) then dead-ends on
 * the return path. Requires `envoyConfig.enabled=true` on the Cilium install
 * (`yaac cluster setup` passes it).
 *
 * `backendServices` is what makes the EDS clusters resolve: Cilium syncs the
 * proxy Service's backend endpoints (for the listed port numbers) into the
 * matching `<ns>/<service>:<port>` clusters, so Envoy dials the proxy pod IP
 * directly rather than a ClusterIP it cannot route to from the host netns.
 *
 * `cecNamespace` is where the CEC lives, or `null` to emit a cluster-scoped
 * `CiliumClusterwideEnvoyConfig` (CCEC) instead — used by the shared vcluster
 * fallback so a per-vcluster CNP can reference it cross-namespace (a CNP's
 * `listener.envoyConfig` ref resolves a namespaced CEC only in the CNP's own
 * namespace, but a CCEC is cluster-scoped). `proxyNamespace`/`proxyService` name
 * the upstream proxy Service its EDS clusters resolve (`backendServices` carries

 * CiliumNetworkPolicy locking the proxy's INGRESS.
 *
 * Key Cilium fact (verified empirically, not the original plan's guess): when
 * the node-local Envoy forwards redirected egress to the proxy, Cilium does
 * NOT relabel the connection as `host`/`ingress`. With the CEC's
 * `use-original-source-address: false` the *source IP* becomes `cilium_host`,
 * but Cilium PRESERVES the original endpoint's **security identity** through
 * the proxy — so at the proxy the redirected traffic carries the *session
 * pod's* identity (`yaac.session-id` label), indistinguishable at L3/L4 from a
 * direct dial. Hence the transparent ports must be opened to the session-pod
 * identity, not to `host`.
 *
 * The forgery lock therefore lives on the **egress** side, not here: a session
 * pod's egress policy (buildSessionEgressRedirectCnpManifest) permits only
 * 443/80→world (redirected via the CEC listener), the tunnel sentinel, and DNS
 * (plus the scoped per-project/per-session registry and vcluster
 * NetworkPolicies) — nothing admits the proxy's transparent ports, so a direct
 * dial is dropped at the source. And because Cilium verifies
 * pod source IPs, the only way to reach a transparent port is the redirect,
 * which stamps the *real* (unspoofable) pod IP into the PROXY-protocol header.
 * The e2e forgery test (a session pod dialing a transparent port directly must
 * fail) is the standing guard.
 *
 * PROXY_PORT (the control API) stays host-only — the server registers sessions
 * over it and the kubelet readiness probe hits it; session pods must not.
