/**
 * Background-loop tick step: garbage-collect the TPROXY rules Cilium leaks
 * when a CiliumEnvoyConfig is deleted (it never removes the per-listener
 * rules from CILIUM_PRE_mangle). Every vcluster teardown leaks its
 * inner-redirect CEC's six rules this way, so they accumulate without bound
 * under session churn — the same CEC-churn residue that has wedged egress
 * before (docs/yaac-in-yaac-inner-egress.md).
 *
 * This lives in the reconcile loop, NOT the vcluster teardown path, because
 * teardown is the wrong moment: namespace deletion runs `--wait=false`, and
 * the rules only become stale once the CEC actually terminates, seconds
 * later. The loop also covers every other teardown route (orphan GC, e2e
 * namespace sweeps, out-of-band deletes) and other installs' leftovers.
 *
 * Staleness is purely existence-driven: a rule is stale iff the config named
 * in its comment (`<ns>/<cec>/<listener>`, ns empty for a cluster-scoped
 * CCEC) no longer exists. No bound-port heuristics — an existing config's
 * rules are never touched, so a listener mid-(re)bind can't be broken.
 *
 * Two-pass confirmation: a rule is deleted only when it was already stale on
 * the PREVIOUS sweep. A CEC deleted and re-created under the same name (the
 * server re-projecting an inner redirect after proxy churn) can leave a
 * freshly-programmed rule that briefly looks stale; by the next sweep its
 * config exists again and the candidate is dropped. Only rules whose config
 * stayed gone for a full sweep interval are removed.
 *
 * Scoped to yaac-owned configs (`yaac-`-prefixed CEC/CCEC names) across ALL
 * installs — existence is a cluster-wide truth, so the ambient server safely
 * sweeps residue from destroyed e2e installs too. Cilium's own proxies (the
 * DNS proxy) don't parse as CEC refs and are never candidates.
