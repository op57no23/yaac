 * Heal the proxy's ssh-agent after a pod replacement. Session
 * registrations survive churn on their own (the proxy write-throughs
 * them to /data and reloads at boot), but agent identities are
 * deliberately memory-only — key bytes never touch the proxy filesystem
 * — so a replaced pod always boots with an empty agent and only the
 * server can re-upload the keys. This is the one proxy heal left on the
 * background tick: session identity is now a per-connection relay token
 * the proxy verifies statelessly, so it needs no healing.
